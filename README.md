# Pandas_Report

## Description

Pandas_Report is a Python-based project that performs various analyses on a dataset contained in a file named 'balance.txt'.
The analyses include calculating average income by ethnicity, comparing the mean balance of married and single people,
finding the highest and lowest income, summing the recorded cards, and counting the number of females and males in the dataset.
The provided Python code performs various analyses on a dataset contained in a file named 'balance.txt'.
The code uses the pandas library to read the data into a DataFrame and then performs operations such as grouping,
filtering, and aggregating the data to calculate various statistics.
The results of these calculations are then printed to the console.
The code also includes conditionals to compare the mean balances of married and single people and print different messages based on the comparison.
The code ends by counting the number of females and males in the dataset and printing the counts.
